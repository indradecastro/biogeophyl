Description: Phylogenetic trees are built from sequenced species (from GenBank or own sequencing). However, it is typical that some species in the study are lacking sequences, thus, it is not possible to include them in the phylogenetic tree. \n Sunplin allows to randomly insert such species in a clade (=under a node given by the resercher). To provide nodes under which an unsequenced species should be found is relatively easy for a single tree, but to do this for multiple trees (as a result of a XXX process of tree construction) can be tedious.  \n Package prosunplin provides a set of functions to: (1) read a file of unsequenced species and their sister species, (2) check that sister species provided are present in the N trees provided, (3) find monophiletic nodes that capture those sister species for each unsequenced species, (4) probabilistically select one of those nodes, (5) randomly insert the unsequenced species below those selected nodes M times (as required by the researcher), in each and all N original trees.
